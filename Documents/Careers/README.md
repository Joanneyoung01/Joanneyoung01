## Skills

### Technical Skills:

- JavaScript, Node and React - I comfortable tackling efforts solo or working in groups, both big and small
- RESTful APIs - I am able to build using REST
- TDD approach - Makers Academy taught me the importance of honing a test drive approach in order to test functionality and behavior first, whilst maintaining high code coverage via unit tests and acceptance tests.
- Object Orientated Programming - 
- Documentation writing - I am able to write clear and concise documentation for anything I write.

**Communication:**

My commercial years in E-commerce and agile delivery provided me with the foundations for clear and concise communication with internal and external teams. I developed skills whereby I was able to communicate with teams on the day to day delivery with internal product or UX teams, as well as stakeholders on the project delivery status updates and showcasing the product build. Relaying what can sometimes be technical jargon into layman's terms was an important skill as it allowed for clear communication and cross-function collaboration.

Presenting products at the weekly 'show and tell meetings'.

**Passionate about UI**

During my time at Beamly my strengths were in being able to take a visual design in sketch, and transforming this into a fully functioning website/campaign page through Javascript, React and HTML/CSS, with pixel perfect precision. I collaborated well with the UX team and was able to help meet the delivery deadlines which delighted clients. 

Redirects - taught me about regex

Agile process changing - Scoped a project for delivery but the clients needs changed so as an engineer our priorities changed

Tight deadlines - we had 2 weeks to build and deliver a website

Accessibility - After topshop was sued for lack of accessibility, alt images and colour contrasting i suggested to beamly that this be addressed

Performance - reduced imagery sizes down for faster performance

UAT testing, A/B testing 

Able to speak to global teams - When building kodo website, i suggested they use flexbox so that the mobile responsiveness is optimised 

### Soft Skills:

**Motivated Self Starter:** My love for coding started when I was in my teenage years. From the confines of my bedroom I taught myself how to develop a simple HTML/CSS website, learning from trial and error, research and asking the right questions. I loved the instant gratification of programming my own website using Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver. I turned this skill into entrepreneurship as I was asked to create bespoke Myspace Layouts, accepting payments via Paypal from overseas clients - as a 14 year old kid who had little to no business experience this was pretty good going. 

I developed this love furthermore on my course at Leeds University. My goal was to gain the right qualifications so that I could pursue a career in tech. From there I graduated and kick started a career in Project Management as I enjoyed the client facing element. I prided myself on the ability to empathize with the technical delivery teams through my experiences in development, this helped manage expectations between delivery teams and stakeholders.

When I joined Beamly, I realised from working so closely with developers that I was fully able to become a developer and I believed in my abilities - I just needed some technical training, after attending codebar and other meet ups i realised I needed formal technical training. In an effort to address this I enrolled on the front end development course at General Asssembly, this gave me the springboard needed to fulfil a lifelong goal to become a developer and I was able to transfer roles from PM to Software Engineer.

**Leadership:** My previous experience leading scrum ceremonies lended itself to the Makers Academy course, as I wanted to contribute to the build process at makers by helping run these within the team and cohort.

A 16-week intensive software engineering bootcamp. Working in a group setting following an Agile framework, using daily standups to ensure delivery of our target features. We used a TDD approach to create a series of fullstack applications using a combination of Ruby and Javascript with frameworks such as Node and React. 

- A neverending curiousity for coding and new technologies
- Always aiming to sharpen my toolset & craft well-written, readable code
- Mentored a student, this helped embed the information I had learnt and enabled me to fully grasp key concepts of the course

## Hobbies and Interests

- I love staying fit and healthy by going to the gym. I am a member at At Your Beat Dance Studio and Base Dance studios, where I go to dance classes a few times a week. I also like to mix this up with Yoga and Pilates.
- I reguarly go to tech events in London, such as Codebar and Developher when I meet and network with others in similar industries. Since lockdown I have been going to the Developher virtual meet ups.
- I volunteer for a charity - Re-engage ([www.reengage.org.uk](http://www.reengage.org.uk/)). This is a charity which connects volunteers to older citizens in the local community (usually 75+) in a bid to tackle loneliness and isolation among the elders. The group co-ordinator role is to organise tea parties for a small group of elders on a monthly basis on weekends. My final project at Makers was based on my volunteer work.
- I have always been one for getting involved in multiple aspects of company life from social committees to Corporate Social Responsibility societies. I have been part of every social committee for every company I have worked for, even stemming back to university life where I was on the social secretary for the Leeds University Cheerleaders.

**Fun fact: I am a qualifed scuba diver**
